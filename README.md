# Daily Dashboard 

This is a small daily dashboard I built to keep track of my goals and stay organised.

## Features
- Live date and time
- Add, edit, check, and delete daily goals
- Goals save automatically (even after refreshing)
- Dark mode 
- Small animations to make it feel nicer

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- localStorage

## Demo
Live version here:

## How It Works
The app uses JavaScript to handle user interactions and `localStorage` to save goals so progress isn’t lost when the page reloads. Everything runs in the browser — no backend needed.

## Why I Made This
I built this project to practice frontend basics and learn how to make simple but useful web apps. I also wanted something I could actually use every day.
